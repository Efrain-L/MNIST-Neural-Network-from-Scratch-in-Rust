# MNIST Neural Network from Scratch in Rust

Implementing a minimal Neural Network in the Rust Programming Language from scratch primarily utilizing the ndarray package. The goal of the network is to correctly identify 28x28 pixel images of handwritten digits from the MNIST data set of 60,000 images. 

The program itself contains three different implementations of a neural network, with each implementation utilizing a different activation function, and then compares the level of accuracy of each activation method with the same parameters for each network.

The test data set contains 10,000 images of handwritten digits which each network is not trained on, and is therefore new to the networks.
